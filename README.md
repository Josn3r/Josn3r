# üí´ About Me:
My name is Josner, born on July 10, 2000. Since I was 16, I've been learning the Java programming language, starting with creating plugins/addons for Minecraft servers in version 1.7, 10, and 1.8. Since then, I've dedicated my entire life to learning Java, updating my knowledge with each framework that has emerged over the years. Despite everything, I feel more comfortable using Java in the most natural way.

Throughout these years of learning, I've learned to work with and implement any API, work with Sockets, HTTP requests, and work with MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB. I've practiced creating applications using Java Swing, FlatLay, MigLayout, and more. I've also learned to work with all versions of Spigot and PaperSpigot, create minigame plugins, or dedicated plugins for Survival/RPG servers. I've even managed to create plugin-to-server socket connections to send and receive information between the Minecraft server and an external client. I called the project "Ariatus," a 100% RPG server with mandatory dependencies on an external application (proximity voice chat, in-game overlay, real-time information, and more). The application is also connected to a forum (Xenforo) for reading featured news or updates. (RSS)

In short, I've been learning Java for over 8 years, improving my knowledge every day and putting it into practice at all times. Although my Github doesn't have many repositories, I can assure you that I have the necessary experience for any project.
